#Explanation:
The query first creates a temporary table named "alltable" that selects all columns from the "fullyear" table. 
It then creates another temporary table named "clean_stations" that selects the ride ID, start and end station IDs, 
and cleans up the start and end station names by removing specific substrings.

Next, the query creates another temporary table named "newtable" that selects the ride ID, the length of the ride in minutes, the month, day of the week, 
and hour the ride started.

Finally, the query selects specific columns from the "alltable", "clean_stations", and "newtable" tables and joins them based on ride ID. 
It also filters out rows where the start or end station name or ID is NULL and contains specific substrings that were removed earlier in the cleaning process. 
(Upon further inspection I noticed that many rows were not filtered using REPLACE function, so I decided to delete them).
