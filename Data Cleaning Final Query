#1) Joined tables by using UNION query 

SELECT DISTINCT ride_id, 
rideable_type, 
started_at, 
ended_at, 
start_station_name, 
start_station_id, 
end_station_name, 
end_station_id, 
start_lat, 
start_lng, 
end_lat, 
end_lng, 
member_casual
FROM `cyclistic-379109.12month.2022_01_trips`
UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT ride_id, 
rideable_type, 
started_at, 
ended_at, 
start_station_name, 
start_station_id, 
end_station_name, 
end_station_id, 
start_lat, 
start_lng, 
end_lat, 
end_lng, 
member_casual
FROM `cyclistic-379109.12month.2022_02_trips`
UNION ALL

(etc. for the rest of the tables)

#2) Created a new  table adding a column with the length of each ride in minutes, 
the month the ride took place in and a column for the day of the week the ride took place (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday).


SELECT ride_id,
            rideable_type,
            started_at,
            ended_at,
            TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, minute) AS ride_length_minutes,
            EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM started_at) AS started_day,
            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at) AS started_month,
            EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) AS started_hour,
            start_station_name,
            start_station_id,
            end_station_name,
            end_station_id,
            start_lat,
            start_lng,
            end_lat,
            end_lng,
            member_casual
FROM `cyclistic-379109.12month.fullyear`



#Then, I checked how many null values are there in the table. 
They appeared to be in start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id. The total number of records is 5,667,717. 
After removing the total number is 4,369,360 or 22% from the total number of records were deleted. 
Going forward, I performed the same analysis for the table with NULL values present, and it didn't affect the conclusions.
