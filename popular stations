#Explanation:
The code first creates a temporary table called "all_data". 
It selects data from two tables where the "start_station_name" and "end_station_name" columns are combined into a single column called "station_name". 
It also selects latitude and longitude data for each station and concatenates them into a single "location" string.

The query also calculates the total number of rides for each station, day of the week, 
and user type (member or casual) and sorts the result by the start date and station name.

In the second part of the query, the code selects the station name, user type, location, and median number of rides per day for each station and user type. 
The median number of rides is calculated using the "PERCENTILE_CONT" function, and it is calculated over each group of member type, station, and location.
