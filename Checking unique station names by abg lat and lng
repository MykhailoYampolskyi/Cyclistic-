#Explanation: 
The query first creates a CTE called names that selects the distinct start and end station names, 
and rounds the average latitude and longitude values for each station to three decimal places. 
The WHERE clause filters out any null station names.
The query then creates another CTE called duplicates that selects the rounded average latitude and longitude values for each station, 
counts the number of times each set of latitude and longitude values appears. 
Finally, the query selects the station name, rounded average latitude and longitude values, and count of stations from both CTEs, 
joining them on the rounded average latitude and longitude values.
